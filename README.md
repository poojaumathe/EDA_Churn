Exploratory Data Analysis:

In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, 
often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us 
beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.
